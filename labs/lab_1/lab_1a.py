I find my passion in both biology and computer science, and I hope to find an intersection where I can apply ML to the vast biological database. Outside of academics, I play the flute in my school in orchestra, wind ensemble, and marching band, while also being a Boy Scout. I love snowboarding and go to Mammoth mountain annually. I can't wait to collaborate with you guys and hope to find many things in common!")
